## Project Name: Let's Learn Chinese
A website for learning basic Chinese. Users can listen to audio and follow along with the text. A translation and pronunciation guide can be revealed by clicking on a button. A 'test your knowledge' section at the bottom allows users to test their knowledge and then click or tap to reveal the answer. There are currently lessons for five different topics.

## Motivation
I am trying to further my skills as a developer so I built this site. I used to live in China so I am familiar with the topic. I tried to design a website that I would have found useful when I was learning Chinese.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- embedded audio
- reveal and hide translation and pronunciation guide
- word translation table
- knowledge test table
- dark theme
- fully responsive web design
- concealed pop-out menu

## Lessons learnt
- embedding audio in a web page and changing its appearance for mobile phones
- tables
- using javascript to change the style of multiple elements of the same class
- creating elements that can be revealed and hidden

## future development
- there is currently no footer section
- more lessons could be added
- I could consult other language learning websites for features this website lacks
